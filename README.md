What a Catholic decision.

"We let Silicon Valley continue on with its rat race competition for tech jobs since around 2014 when cloud computing hit the scene. We let in a lot of security vulnerabilities because around 80% of our 
electronics are Chinese manufactures. We'd rather do that than establish electronics manufacturing plants in technologically disparate regions of the US, such as the South. Because we let in all these 
security vulnerabilities, there are too many IT crimes being committed for our legal system to handle. We enable foreign cyberterrorists, mainly from Europe, as part of NATO/Russia pacts. We also enable 
Whatever capital comes our way due to information technology, around 50% of that gets gobbled up by the legal industry, and of the remainder, around 30% goes to stakeholders, 15% to foreign workers, and 5% 
to everyone else. We also let our media industry and their leftist affiliates start a bunch of culture wars over disinformation and media portrayals. Then we let rightists harass minorities and start fights 
with leftists. Then we just sit back and watch the blood spill. We intervene from time to time, but only to seize possessions and keep some people broke." ~ The U.S. Government 

"Information technology is no longer the industry. It's been democratized, and many foreign-born workers are way more talented than you. Look at your grades from college. You failed calculus. That must mean 
that you're numerically retarded. Forget about your STEM degree. You need to serve 7 years in the U.S. Navy. You can sing sailor songs daily while you're there. You might even get the chance to go fight in 
Southeast Asia. By the way, we did, in fact, let countries such as the UK help start a civil war over in Burma in recent years. We also use Filipino spies to tail all the Asians. They were supposed to be 
resistance against the Chinese Communist Party. But since China already bought them out, they might have a bone to pick with people such as you. And that's why you need to join the U.S. Navy. It's a safer 
route than competing with homos like Peter Thiel and white supremacist retards for capital." ~ The U.S. Government 

"Since we enabled a bunch of liars to spread their commercials, as well as a lot of disinformation in the name of freedom of speech, we'll let you put words in our mouths. But if you step up too hard to us, 
we might try to have you killed." ~ The U.S. Government
